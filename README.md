# BasicAndroidCppJniProject
Just having fun learning JNI on Android !

I have started with the basic Android NDK C++ project generated by Android Studio.

Then I have followed the procedure at https://github.com/google/oboe/blob/master/docs/GettingStarted.md
The procedure I followed is the "Option 2) Building from source".
