# BasicAndroidCppJniProject
Just having fun learning JNI (Google OBOE) on Android !

I have started with the basic Android NDK C++ project generated by Android Studio.

Then I have followed the procedure "Option 2) Building from source" at https://github.com/google/oboe/blob/master/docs/GettingStarted.md

Then I have made all necessary changes to the Android project in order to have the OboeSinePlayer class work, that is given as an example on the same page in the Example section at  https://github.com/google/oboe/blob/master/docs/GettingStarted.md 

After that, the work that has been done to have OBOE working is the following :

- Adding the class OboeSinePlayer.cpp (and the header OboeSinePlayer.h)
- Copying the code from the Example section to the OboeSinePlayer.cpp)
